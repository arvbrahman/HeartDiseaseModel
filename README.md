## Introduction :wave:

HeartDiseaseModel leverages the **Heart Disease UCI Dataset** to predict the presence of heart disease based on health parameters such as age, chest pain type, and maximum heart rate. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface for quick predictions, aiding early detection efforts.

---

## Features :star2:

- **Prediction Model**: Logistic regression-based heart disease classifier.  
- **Interactive Interface**: Responsive web design with a modern look.  
- **Seamless Workflow**: Backend and frontend integration for real-time predictions.  
- **Portable Model**: Saved as `heart_disease_model.pkl` for easy reuse.

---

## Workflow :arrow_forward:

1. **Input Collection**: Users input health parameters (age, chest pain type, max heart rate).  
2. **Backend Processing**: Inputs are processed, and the trained logistic regression model predicts the outcome.  
3. **Result Display**: The result (positive/negative for heart disease) is shown on the interface.

---

## Technologies Used :computer:

- **Python**: Core logic and backend processing.  
- **Flask**: Backend web framework.  
- **HTML/CSS**: Responsive and user-friendly frontend.  
- **scikit-learn**: Logistic regression model.  
- **Joblib**: Model saving/loading.  
- **Seaborn/Matplotlib**: Data visualization during development.
